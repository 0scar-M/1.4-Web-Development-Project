        <h2>Map</h2>
        <h2 class="line">━━</h2>
        <p>Here you can see a map of the Turks along the Mahu Whenua Traverse. The Turks are all quite easy to find as the land is open and they are easily recognisable, but it is still a good idea to have a precise map/gps showing their locations in case of a white-out. Route finding can also be a bit difficult in a white-out or spring when the snow is limited to the south faces, so be careful. </p>

      <h2>Route</h2>
      <h2 class="line">━━</h2>
      
      <h3>Treble Cone to Polnoon Saddle</h3>
      <p class="turk-text">This is by far the longest day by distance, but as it is mostly downhill, it's pretty easy. However, the snow line is often above the level of the Turk so expect some walking.</p>

      <h3>Polnoon Saddle to Mount Hyde</h3>
      <p class="turk-text">The first part of this section is a steep climb up to Siberia that often has no snow because of its northern aspect. However, there is a nice ski down to the Turk at the end.</p>

      <h3>Mount Hyde to Mount Saint Just</h3>
      <p class="turk-text">First up, you have to traverse a steep slope that if icy is only possible on crampons. You then have a nice ski down Mount Hyde before a short skin up to the Turk.</p>

      <h3>Mount Saint Just to Vanguard Peak</h3>
      <p class="turk-text">This is most likely the shortest day, but it does traverse some quite steep and avalanche-prone terrain, so be careful.</p>

      <h3>Vanguard Peak to Deep Creek</h3>
      <p class="turk-text">This is the big down day, with some lovely skiing on the south face of Vanguard, but the snow does often disappear well below the bottom of the valley.</p>

      <h3>Deep Creek to Coronet Peak</h3>
      <p class="turk-text">This is the big up day, with even less snow than the previous day as it is north-facing, but it's the last day, so enjoy!</p>
