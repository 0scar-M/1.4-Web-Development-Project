        <p>The Mahu Whenua Traverse is a ski-touring traverse (although people often do it in summer on foot as well) that goes from Treble Cone ski-field in Wanaka to Coronet Peak ski-field in Queenstown across the Mahu Whenua land convent, with five huts fashioned from well insulated water tanks known as "Turks". The Turks were built by and are maintained by Eric Bradshaw and the Mountain Turk Club, of which he is the founder and current president. The Turks have two bunk beds and are well supplied with gas cookers, fuel, toilet paper, bowls/cutlery, extra blankets and a long drop toilet seperate from the Turk. The inventive name comes from the combination of the words tank, hut and yurt. Because of the cost of building, maintaining and supplying these huts, you have to be a member of the club to use them.</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <h2 class="line">━━</h2>
        <p>One day, while comiserating about the expense and planning required to build an alpine hut, inventive skier Eric Bradshaw realised that you could build a hut out of a large water tank. This would offer a cheap and easily assembleable alpine hut that could be prefabricated over a month or two then installed by helicopter in just one day. Thus the Turk, and shortly afterwards, the Mountain Turk Club were born. Skiers had been doing the Mahu Whenua Traverse for many years before the exisistence of the Mountain Turk Club with people sleeping in snow caves, but having huts like the Turks along the traverse would open it up to a much wider range of abilities. The first goal of the Club was to build a Turk located between Crown Peak and Mt. Sale above the Whakatipu Basin, and that was acheived in late 2018. The next and ultimate goal of the Club was the holy grail of the five Turks between Treble Cone and Coronet Peak. After many working bees and fundraising, they were finally installed in 2021, completing the ultimate goal that Eric set out to accomplish with the Mountain Turk Club. However, the club is still on lookout for new locations for Turks or even a new traverse.</p>
